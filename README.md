### Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks

The goal of this project is to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices based on user-inputted text descriptions of these products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.  
The proposition is to use **RNN** (Recurrent Neural Networks) in association with **RidgeCV** (Ridge regression with built-in cross-validation).
